Research Background With the arrival of the AI era, the computational power
    and decision-making capabilities of computers have been greatly enhanced, enabling
    them to assist humans in navigating the complex and volatile financial markets.
    Portfolio management refers to the process of dynamically allocating capital
    to different assets. In a dynamic market, there are many factors that affect
    portfolio optimization, such as market sentiment, policy changes, and weather
    factors, making sustained success in trading difficult. The semi-strong efficient
    market hypothesis suggests that all trading data and public information are immediately
    reflected in asset prices, so the algorithm’s data sources are mainly
    historical trading data. On the other hand, because markets are not fully
    efficient, there are still opportunities to achieve returns above the market
    average through data mining. This study focuses on portfolio optimization in
    the field of quantitative finance, attempting to compare the effects of reinforcement
    learning algorithms, non-traditional optimization methods, an
